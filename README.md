# Predicting-Forest-Fires-in-Algeria-with-Machine-Learning
This project highlights how machine learning can be leveraged to predict and mitigate forest fire risks by analyzing weather data. The substantial improvement in model accuracy underscores the value of feature selection, regularization techniques (Ridge/Lasso), and ensemble methods in building robust, real-world predictive systems.
